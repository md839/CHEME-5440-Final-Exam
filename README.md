# CHEME-5440-Final-Exam
Final Exam submission for Michael Delaney.

Hand written answers to the problems were provided in the form of JPG files, with referenced julia code and excel spreadsheets.
If there are any questions about the answering of the exam please feel free to email me. Note: Q3 is unfinished, however I wanted to submit the other questions before the deadline since I did have them done in time. If there is a late penalty, I hope it would only apply to Q3, as I did submit everything else on time.
